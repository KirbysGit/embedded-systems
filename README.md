# Embedded Systems (EEL 4742C)

## Overview

Welcome to my **Embedded Systems (EEL 4742C)** repository! This repository contains lab assignments and projects that demonstrate practical applications of embedded systems concepts using the Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller and BoosterPack MKII. Each file showcases programming techniques for real-time embedded applications, including handling interrupts, timers, communication protocols, and interfacing with peripherals.
